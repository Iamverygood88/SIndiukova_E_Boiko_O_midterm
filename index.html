         <h1>Starbucks and Tim Hortons</h1>

         <h3>Starbucks</h3>
    		<p>Starbucks is one of the most famous companies which is selling quality coffee. They have high-quality coffee beans, hand grinding, light roasting. They use only natural and high-quality products.<br>Also, Starbucks has a professional design in their coffee shops. It is nice to come and work there, if you are a freelancer, for example. <br> In Starbucks, you can often see different updates which the help company attract new customers and keep the target audience. <br> In my opinion Starbucks is the best company in its market and cannot be compared with Tim Hortons. As in Tim Hortons tasteless and cheap drinks. The only plus is donats.<br>

    		<h3>Tim Hortons better than Starbucks</h3>
        <p> It is the best and the biggest Canada's quick service restaurant.<br>Famous and loved for its coffee drinks and sweet donuts. Founded in 1964 in Hamilton, Ontario, by the famous Canadian hockey player Tim Horton under the <br> brand "Horton Donuts." It currently has about 3,000 branches worldwide, in fact being the largest and spreaded fast food system in Canada. <br>Tim Hortons controls more than 50% of the hot coffee beverage market. Tim Hortons always uses hight quality coffee beens and local products for preparing food.<br>
        The menu contains a number of other baked goods, such as doughnut holes (branded as Timbits), muffins, croissants, tea biscuits, cookies, rolls, danishes, and bagels. <br>Hortons serves other types of drinks as well, and in the mid-1990s the chain moved into specialty and premium items such as flavored cappuccino, iced cappuccino, and iced coffee. <br>"Always fresh" policy where coffee is served within 20 minutes of brewing made Tim Hortons the most reliable and loved coffee cafe in Canada.<br> Tim Hortons beter than Starbucks because Starbucks dont cares about clients, does not have the individuality.
